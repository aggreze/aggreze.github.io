Take a look at the file `Doc/Site_internet_20251009.pdf`. It encloses the description of the website pages of an painting artist.
Here are some details about the content:
- there are 5 pages accessible from the menu: Accueil, Biographie, Galerie, Actualité et Contact
- The main page contains:
	 - A first presentational section of the site with a background image and the artist's signature.
	 - below is a menu with shortcuts to the other pages
	 - and then 3 shortcuts to the gallery categories "Huile", "Acrylique", et "Mine de Plomb" with images as links.
- The galery is one single page with anchors from the menu. It is divided by technique (main category) and themes (sub-category).
	- When clicking on an artwork miniature, it opens in a caroussel which can explore the theme
- The actualities pages is divided in upcoming events, and passed events. When an event is clicked, it shows the event details (Name of event, location, dates, opening hours, a small description of the hosting venue, etc...).
Finally the footer provides links to a patreon (Mécénat in french) page, and a legal mentions page.
All images are in the `assets` folder.
Main font is Calibri, secondary font (for artwork names) is Lucida Calligraphy.
Color codes are:
- background color: #232832
- writing: white
- menu bar: black
- footer background, links, and menu items: #FFCCCC
I want you to generate a static simple web site in french based on this document.
